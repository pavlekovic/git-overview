# Python Fundamentals

Python built-in data types include:
- Numbers: Integers (e.g. 1, 55), and floating point numbers (e.g. 5.47, 88.55)
- Strings: Anything that involves characters or text
- Boolean: Either True or False

To check the type of a variable, `type(<variable>)` can be used.

## Numbers
Python supports a range of math operators when it comes to numbers:
- Add (+)
- Subtract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Divide (/)
- Modulo (%) - operator that returns remainder of division

## Strings
To store strings, single or double quotation marks are used. There is a range of built-in functions Python uses to work with strings:
- `concatenate` -> Used to combine multiple strings ()

## Booleans and equality operators
- `==` -> Equal to
- `!=` -> Not equal to
- `>` -> Greater than
- `<` -> Less than
- `>=` -> Greater than or equal to
- `<=` -> Less than or equal to

## Variables
Variables are containers used to store values. When initializing a variable, Python will automatically assign type to a variable based on the value being stored.
